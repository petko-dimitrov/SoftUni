Exercises: Files, Directories and Exceptions
============================================

Problems for exercises and homework for the ["Programming Fundamentals"
course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-fundamentals).

This exercise does **NOT** have **Judge Contest**. That means that you
will need to **create input and output files** from the examples and
**test** the solutions on your own.

 Most Frequent Number
---------------------

Write a program that finds the **most frequent number** in a given
sequence of numbers.

-   Numbers will be in the range **\[0...65535\]**.

-   In case of multiple numbers with the same maximum frequency, print
    the **leftmost** one.

Read the input from a file and save the result in new file
\"output.txt\"

### Examples

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| **input.txt**         | **output.txt**        | **Comments**          |
+=======================+=======================+=======================+
| **4** 1 1 **4** 2 3   | 4                     | The number **4** is   |
| **4 4** 1 2 **4** 9 3 |                       | the most frequent     |
|                       | 2                     | (occurs 5 times)      |
| **2 2 2 2** 1 **2 2   |                       |                       |
| 2**                   | 7                     | The number **2** is   |
|                       |                       | the most frequent     |
| **7 7 7** 0 2 2 2 0   |                       | (occurs 7 times)      |

|                       |                       | The numbers **2**,    |
|                       |                       | **7** and **10** have |
|                       |                       | the same maximal      |
|                       |                       | frequence. The        |
|                       |                       | leftmost of them is   |
|                       |                       | **7**.                |

Index of Letters
----------------

Write a program that creates an array containing all letters from the
alphabet (**a**-**z**). Read a lowercase word from a file \"input.txt\"
and write the **index of each of its letters in the letters array in the
\"output.txt\" file**.

### Examples

+---------------+----------------+
| **input.txt** | **output.txt** |
+===============+================+
| abcz          | a -\> 0        |
|               |                |
|               | b -\> 1        |
|               |                |
|               | c -\> 2        |
|               |                |
|               | z -\> 25       |

Count of Symbols
----------------

Write a program that reads a text from a file \"input.txt\" and counts
the occurrences of each symbol in the text. Write in a file each symbol
along its count, ordered by most occurrences.

### Examples

+---------------+----------------+
| **input.txt** | **output.txt** |
+===============+================+
| Hello, C\#!   | l -\> 2        |
|               |                |
|               | H -\> 1        |
|               |                |
|               | e -\> 1        |
|               |                |
|               | o -\> 1        |
|               |                |
|               | , -\> 1        |
|               |                |
|               | C -\> 1        |
|               |                |
|               | \# -\> 1       |
|               |                |
|               | ! -\> 1        |
+---------------+----------------+

Max Sequence of Equal Elements
------------------------------

Read a **file with lines of integers** and find the **longest sequence
of equal elements on each line**. If several exist, take the
**leftmost**. Write the result in a file output.txt.

### Examples

+---------------------+----------------+
| **input.txt**       | **output.txt** |
+=====================+================+
| 3 4 4 **5 5 5** 2 2 | 5 5 5          |
|                     |                |
| **7 7** 4 4 5 5 3 3 | 7 7            |
|                     |                |
| 1 2 **3 3**         | 3 3            |
+---------------------+----------------+

### Hints

-   Scan positions **p** from left to right and keep the **start** and
    **length** of the current sequence of equal numbers ending at **p**.

-   Keep also the currently best (longest) sequence (**bestStart** +
    **bestLength**) and update it after each step.

Fix Emails
----------

You are given a sequence of strings, each on a new line, **until you
receive "stop" command**. First string is a name of a person. On the
second line, you receive his email. Your task is to collect their names
and emails, and remove emails whose domain ends with \"**us**\" or
\"**uk**\" (case insensitive). Print:

**{name} -- \> {email}**

Advertisement Message
---------------------

Write a program that **generate random fake advertisement message** to
extol some product. The messages must consist of 4 parts: laudatory
**phrase** + **event** + **author** + **city**. Use the following
predefined parts:

-   **Phrases** -- {"Excellent product.", "Such a great product.", "I
    always use that product.", "Best product of its category.",
    "Exceptional product.", "I can't live without this product."}

-   **Events** -- {"Now I feel good.", "I have succeeded with this
    product.", "Makes miracles. I am happy of the results!", "I cannot
    believe but now I feel awesome.", "Try it yourself, I am very
    satisfied.", "I feel great!"}

-   **Author** -- {"Diana", "Petya", "Stella", "Elena", "Katya", "Iva",
    "Annie", "Eva"}

-   **Cities** -- {"Burgas", "Sofia", "Plovdiv", "Varna", "Ruse"}

The format of the output message is: **{phrase} {event} {author} --
{city}**.

As an input, you take the **number of messages from the console** to be
generated. Write each random message at a separate line in the
output.txt.

### Examples

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Input**                         | **output.txt**                    |
+===================================+===================================+
| 3                                 | Such a great product. Now I feel  |
|                                   | good. Elena -- Ruse               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Excelent product. Makes miracles. |
|                                   | I am happy of the results! Katya  |
|                                   | -- Varna                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Best product of its category.     |
|                                   | That makes miracles. Eva - Sofia  |

### Hints

-   Hold the **phrases**, **events**, **authors** and **towns** in 4
    arrays of strings.

-   Create **Random** object and generate 4 random numbers each in its
    range:

    -   phraseIndex Â­\[0, phrases.Length\]

    -   eventIndex \[0, events.Length\]

    -   authorIndex \[0, authors.Length\]

    -   townIndex \[0, towns.Length\]

-   Get one **random element** from each of the four arrays and
    **compose a message** in the required format.
